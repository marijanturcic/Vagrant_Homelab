Introduction

Greetings, welcome to my homelab repository. This repository contains all the code for my DevOps lab. Here you will find code for Ansible playbooks, simple Vagrantfiles for provisioning as well as various other DevOps related files.

This is a personal project serving as a playground for acquiring hands on experience and knowledge in DevOps practices.

The repository shall be updated regularly as I make my way through learning all the tools and concepts.

Feel free to use any of the files as your own templates for your own homelab.

Requirements

So far the repository only contains some basic Vagrantfiles and Ansible playbooks for provisioning CentOS 8 VM's as well as installing various software required to run the servers.

So far the requirements for running the homelab are:

Conclusion

This is it for the homelab so far, stop by from time to time to check for updates, enjoy the files and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Goodbye!
